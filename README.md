- **Availability Check**: Instantly see if a title is available in HD (1080p) or 4K, based on your Overseerr library.
- **Title Requests**: Request missing titles in HD, 4K, or both, respecting Overseerr user permissions for quality settings.
- **Issue Reporting**: Report issues like video glitches, audio sync problems, missing subtitles, or other playback errors for existing titles.
- **Notification Management**: Customize Telegram notifications for Overseerr events (e.g., request approvals, media availability) with options to enable/disable or use silent mode.
- **Admin Controls**: Admins can switch operation modes, toggle Group Mode, create new Overseerr users, and manage bot settings via an intuitive menu.
- **Password Protection**: Secure bot access with an optional password, ensuring only authorized users can interact.
- **Group Mode**: Restrict bot usage to a specific Telegram group or thread, ideal for collaborative media management in shared environments like family or friend groups.

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki):

- **Ubuntu (Source Installation)**: Follow the guide at [Installation on Ubuntu](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki#4-installation-on-ubuntu).
- **Docker**: Deploy with Docker or Docker Compose using the instructions at [Installation with Docker](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki#5-installation-with-docker).

---

## Operation Modes

The bot supports three operation modes, configurable by the admin via `/settings`, catering to different use cases:

- **Normal Mode**:

  - Users log in with their individual Overseerr credentials (email and password).
  - Requests and issue reports are tied to each user‚Äôs Overseerr account, ensuring personalized tracking.
  - Ideal for users with their own Overseerr accounts who want full control over their requests and notifications.

- **API Mode**:

  - Users select an existing Overseerr user from a list without needing credentials, using the Overseerr API key for requests.
  - Simplifies access for users without Overseerr accounts, with requests automatically approved by Overseerr.
  - Issue reports are attributed to the admin‚Äôs account due to API key usage.
  - Best for environments where quick access is prioritized over individual account management.

- **Shared Mode**:

  - All users share a single Overseerr account configured by the admin, streamlining group usage.
  - The admin logs in once, and all requests and issue reports use this shared account.
  - Perfect for small groups (e.g., families or friends) sharing a media server, with notifications sent to a common Telegram chat.

Learn more about configuring modes in the [Wiki](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki).

## Managing Notifications

Users can configure Overseerr Telegram notifications via `/settings`:

- **Enable/Disable Notifications**: Turn on/off notifications for events like request approvals, media availability, or errors.
- **Silent Mode**: Opt for silent notifications without sound, ideal for minimizing disruptions during quiet hours.
- In Shared Mode, only admins configure notifications for the shared account, applying to all users.

Example: Enable notifications to receive a Telegram message when "The Witcher" becomes available, or set silent mode for nighttime updates.

## Reporting Issues

From media details returned by `/check`, users can report issues for pending or available titles, such as:

- Video issues (e.g., pixelation, buffering)
- Audio issues (e.g., out-of-sync, missing tracks)
- Subtitle issues (e.g., incorrect timing, missing files)
- Other playback problems

Reports are submitted to Overseerr, with attribution based on the operation mode (individual user in Normal Mode, admin in API Mode, shared account in Shared Mode).

## Group Mode

Group Mode enhances collaborative usage by restricting bot interactions to a designated Telegram group or thread:

- **Enable Group Mode**: Only the admin can activate this via `/settings`, storing the setting in `data/bot_config.json`.
- **Set Primary Chat**: Running `/start` in a group or thread sets it as the primary chat, identified by `primary_chat_id`.
- **Usage**: When active, all commands (`/start`, `/check`) and notifications are confined to the primary chat/thread, ignoring other chats. This ensures a unified experience for group members.
- **Example**: In a family Telegram group, users request "Toy Story" via `/check`, and the bot responds only in that group, with notifications (e.g., ‚ÄúToy Story is available‚Äù) sent to all members.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for shared media servers (e.g., Plex) where a group collaborates on requests, keeping communication centralized.

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

- **How do I set up the bot for the first time?**\
  Follow the installation guides in the [Wiki](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki) for Ubuntu or Docker.

- **What if I forget the bot password?**\
  The password is set via the `PASSWORD` environment variable or `config.py`. Admins can reset it by updating the configuration. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki) for details.

- **Why can‚Äôt I request 4K titles?**  
  4K requests depend on Overseerr permissions:
  - Normal Mode: Tied to the user‚Äôs account permissions.
  - API Mode: Tied to the selected user‚Äôs permissions.
  - Shared Mode: Tied to the shared account‚Äôs permissions.  
  Check Overseerr settings or contact your admin.

- **Why don‚Äôt I see the ‚ÄúManage Notifications‚Äù option in /settings?**  
  The ‚ÄúManage Notifications‚Äù button appears only after selecting an Overseerr user (via login in Normal Mode, user selection in API Mode, or admin login in Shared Mode). Use `/settings` to log in or select a user first.

- **How do I troubleshoot bot errors?**  
  Check the bot logs in the console or `data/` directory. Common issues include incorrect `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, `OVERSEERR_API_URL`, or `OVERSEERR_API_KEY`. Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki) for troubleshooting tips.
